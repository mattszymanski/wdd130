            <p>Utah was inhabited by numerous indigenous groups, and explored by the Spanish in the 1700's. Utah was settled in 1847 by the Mormon pioneers who created numerous settlements. Santa Clara was settled in 1854 by Jacob Hamblin and was later settled by immigrant Latter-day Saints from Switzerland.</p>
